1. Do these results match what you found in your previous peer review? Why or why not?

Yes, the Bandit scan results closely match the vulnerabilities I identified during the peer review. Specifically, Bandit flagged the following issues:
  Command Injection via os.system: I had noted this vulnerability and recommended using Python’s smtplib for sending emails, which my teammate implemented.
  Insecure HTTP Request: Bandit identified the insecure use of HTTP, which I addressed by changing the URL to use HTTPS.
  SQL Injection Risk: Bandit highlighted the SQL injection vulnerability due to string-based query construction, which I discussed in my review but hadn't modified in the code.

The scan results aligned with most of what I found, confirming Bandit's effectiveness in identifying key vulnerabilities. However, Bandit didn’t catch the lack of input validation and missing exception handling, which I also flagged.

2. Do you think they caught all the vulnerabilities present in the code? Why or why not?

No, the scan didn’t catch all vulnerabilities. While Bandit successfully identified major issues like command injection, insecure HTTP requests, and potential SQL injection, it missed:
   Lack of Input Validation: Bandit didn't flag the absence of input validation in the get_user_input() function, which could lead to injection or malformed data.
   Missing Exception Handling: The absence of error handling in functions like get_data() and save_to_db() was not detected by Bandit.
   Hardcoded Credentials: Bandit didn’t flag the hardcoded credentials issue, though it’s a critical security flaw.

Automated scanners like Bandit are excellent at catching specific known issues but may miss contextual vulnerabilities or logic errors, emphasizing the need for manual code reviews.

3. Why is using multiple code scanners better than using one?

Using multiple scanners like CodeQL, SuperLinter, and Bandit provides a more comprehensive security assessment because:

   Different Focus Areas: Each tool specializes in identifying different types of issues. Bandit focuses on Python security flaws, CodeQL performs deep code analysis for vulnerabilities, and SuperLinter checks for code style, syntax errors, and potential bugs.
   Coverage: Multiple tools increase the likelihood of catching various issues, as some vulnerabilities may be missed by one scanner but detected by another.
   Reducing False Negatives: Combining scanners minimizes the chance that vulnerabilities go undetected due to tool limitations.
   Broader Language Support: Some tools support multiple languages, allowing you to scan projects with mixed language codebases effectively.

Overall, a multi-scanner approach leads to more robust and secure code by covering gaps that a single tool might leave.

4. Test out some code from different languages as well, to see how the GitHub actions perform.

I tested JavaScript and Java code in addition to Python:

   JavaScript (Node.js) Code: A simple function to add two numbers, using readline for user input.
   Java Code: A basic program to validate user age input, ensuring the age isn't negative.

Scan Results Overview:

   CodeQL: Successfully scanned both JavaScript and Java code.
   Bandit: As expected, Bandit only scans Python code, so it failed when scanning non-Python files, which is reflected in the results.
   SuperLinter: Successfully linted both JavaScript and Java code without issues, ensuring coding standards were met.

The tests confirmed that GitHub Actions tools handle different languages effectively when configured correctly, except for Bandit, which is Python-specific.

5.  Reflection Question: How did the AppScan CodeSweep scan performance compare to the previous code scanners you used? Be specific. (i.e., CodeQL and Bandit)

In my evaluation, the AppScan CodeSweep scanner performed differently compared to CodeQL and Bandit, each having its strengths and weaknesses.

   AppScan CodeSweep completed its scan successfully without identifying any security issues in my code. The scan was quick, taking approximately 31 seconds to complete, and the GitHub action ran smoothly without errors. The CodeSweep scan seemed to focus on broader security issues but missed some specific vulnerabilities that Bandit detected.

   CodeQL performed a more thorough analysis, taking around 1 minute and 33 seconds. It provided a deeper inspection of the code structure and logic, which could catch complex vulnerabilities beyond what CodeSweep detected. However, CodeQL didn't flag any issues in my code, suggesting it may have a higher threshold for reporting issues or that my code met its standards.

   Bandit was the most effective at identifying specific Python security vulnerabilities. It quickly detected three issues: a high-severity command injection risk via os.system, a medium-severity insecure HTTP request, and a medium-severity SQL injection risk due to string-based query construction. The scan failed to complete successfully due to configuration issues, which is a drawback compared to the reliability shown by CodeQL and CodeSweep.

Comparison Summary:

   CodeSweep was fast and reliable but less sensitive, failing to detect vulnerabilities that Bandit caught.
   CodeQL provided deep code analysis but did not report issues, possibly indicating either stronger code quality or missed vulnerabilities.
   Bandit was the most effective for Python-specific issues, identifying critical vulnerabilities that CodeSweep missed, but it struggled with reliability in my GitHub Actions setup.

In conclusion, while AppScan CodeSweep performed well in terms of speed and reliability, it did not match Bandit’s effectiveness in identifying specific vulnerabilities. Combining multiple tools like CodeQL, Bandit, and CodeSweep ensures broader coverage and increases the chance of identifying all vulnerabilities in the code.
